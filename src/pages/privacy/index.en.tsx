                <h2>Other important privacy policies</h2>
                <p>
                    Our products are suitable for both individuals and organizations. Where we
                    provide services to you via an organization (e.g. your employer), the
                    organization serves as the administrator of services and is responsible for the
                    terminal users and service sites under its control. Under such a circumstance,
                    you may submit your data privacy requirements to the administrator as your use
                    of our services is subject to the policies of the organization. We are not
                    responsible for privacy or security practices of the organization, namely the
                    administrator, which may vary from our policies. Even if services are not under
                    the administration of an organization currently, your team’s administrator or
                    the owner of the domain associated to your organization’s email (e.g. your
                    employer) may also manage and control your account and use our services
                    afterwards as you are a member of a team under the administration of the
                    organization or you access our services with the email address provided by the
                    organization (e.g. your work email address). Under such a circumstance, you will
                    receive a notice. The task owner, project administrator and corporate
                    administrator can restrict your access and right to the task, project and
                    enterprise. Under some circumstances, the corporate administrator may also:
                </p>
                <li>Require you to reset your account password</li>
                <li>Restrict, suspend or terminate your access to services or your account</li>
                <li>
                    Control your power to edit, restrict, amend or delete your account information
                </li>
                <li>
                    Change your account information, including personal information or email address
                    related to your account

                <li>Access the information in your account</li>
                <li>Activate or deactivate third-party applications</li>
                <p>
                    If you do not want the administrator to control your account and use of
                    services, you may choose to exit from the enterprise, project, and task, and
                    delete the any email with the domain owned or controlled by the administrator.
                    Once the administrator announces the control right to your account and use of
                    services, you may have no right to change the email address associated to your
                    account without the approval of the administrator. Please contact your
                    organization or your administrator for more information on the policies of the

                    THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SECTION APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS
                    BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN
                    IF WHITE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. THE FOREGOING

                <p>
                    THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SECTION APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS
                    BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
                    WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
                    DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS
                    AGREEMENT GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS
                    WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE. THE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, AND LIMITATIONS OF
                    LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY

                </p>
                <p>
                    The Service is controlled and operated from its facilities in the United States.
                    We make no representations that the Service is appropriate or available for use
                    in other locations. Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions
                    do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all
                    applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including but not
                    limited to export and import regulations. You may not use the Service if you are
                    a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or are a foreign person
                    or entity blocked or denied by the United States government. Unless otherwise
                    explicitly stated, all materials found on the Service are solely directed to
                    individuals, companies, or other entities located in the United States.
                </p>
                <h2>MISCELLANEOUS LEGAL TERMS</h2>
                <p>
                    These Terms and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be
                    transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by us without restriction.
                    Any attempted transfer or assignment by you will be null and void.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the unlikely event that White has not been able to resolve a dispute it has
                    with you after attempting to do so informally, we each agree to resolve any
                    claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any White claims for injunctive or
                    other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this
                    Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by
                    binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in the city
                    of San Francisco, California under the commercial rules then in effect for the
                    AAA, except as provided herein. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall
                    include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs
                    for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the
                    arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in
                    this Section shall be deemed as preventing White from seeking injunctive or
                    other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to protect any of White’s
                    proprietary interests. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL
                    CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
                    REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU
                    AND WHITE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A
                    CLASS ACTION.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You agree that the Service is based in Shanghai; and these Terms are governed by
                    the internal substantive laws of China, without respect to its conflict of laws
                    principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
                    the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These Terms, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may
                    enter into with White in connection with the Service, will constitute the entire
                    agreement between you and White concerning the Service. If any provision of
                    these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
                    invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
                    provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No waiver of any sections of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing
                    waiver of such term or any other term, and White’s failure to assert any right
                    or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
                    provision.
